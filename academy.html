									Daniel 'Bonk' Flynn has been a dedicated player of the Counter-Strike series since its early 1.6 days, introduced to the game by his father. 
									His passion for Counter-Strike intensified with the release of CSGO, leading to his first semi-professional stint with Serpentis Esports. 
									During his time with Serpentis, Daniel participated in numerous local LAN events and traveled across North America for various tournaments. <br>
									After a brief hiatus to serve in the U.S. Army, Daniel returned to the gaming scene with a wealth of experience and a desire to develop the next generation of Counter-Strike professionals. 
									He founded his academy, incorporating the skills and techniques he honed during his military service, to share his knowledge and foster new talent in the esports community.
